<p>When a feature is categorical, there are two pitfalls that a machine 
	learning system could fall into, so we perform these steps to indicate, 
	as necessary, to the computer that the data is to be seen as categorical. 
	<ol>
		<li>The machine could get distracted by the letters in a name and think 
			that there is some significance. We solve this by converting the names
		into numerical categories, or factors.</li>
		<li>The machine could, then, get distracted by the ordering of numbers and 
			think that there is some kind of superiority between the factors. We 
			solve this by using one-hot encoding, or separating one feature with n 
			factors into n Boolean features, such that the value is True if the 
			example is of that category. Note that factors in R take care of this by 
		default.</li>
	</ol>
