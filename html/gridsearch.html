<p>Grid search provides an exhaustive search of all combinations of specified hyperparameters. The combinations are like coordinates in a grid, which is where it gets the name. Each combination may also be repeated in \(k\)-folds cross validation to get a reasonably accurate result. An optimal combination is chosen according to a scoring metric.</p>

<p>The code below demonstrates, for example, how k-folds cross-validation might be used to find the best \(k\) in a k-nearest neighbors model, or the best <span class="code">sigma</span>, <span class="code">C</span>, and <span class="code">epsilon</span> in a support vector regression model. The general process is to look up the documentations for the respective models and find their identifier and the names of their parameters. The models are identified in R by the <span class="code">method</span> parameter, which takes in a string; and in Python by the class name under <span class="code">sklearn</span>. This is generally supported for all <span class="code">sklearn</span> models in Python, and all <span class="code">caret</span> models in R. Since the <span class="code">caret</span> library supports numerous models in other libraries, this is usually sufficient. However, it may not have all the options or tunable parameters.</p>

<p>The advantage to using R here is that a neat report and plot demonstrating results is easily generatable. In Python, the best parameters, the corresponding best cross validation score (see <span class="code">cross_val_score()</span>), and <span class="code">best_index_</span> corresponding to the index of the best parameters in the <span class="code">grid_search.cv_results_</span> dictionary. To get the actual parameter settings from this, use <span class="code">grid_search.cv_results_['params'][search.best_index_]</span>.</p>

<p>The scoring metric can be changed by using one of the predefined options for parameters <span class="code">metric</span> in R and <span class="code">scoring</span> in Python. A good choice for regression is <span class="code">mse</span> in R and <span class="code">mean_squared_error</span> in Python. A good choice for classification is <span class="code">accuracy</span> in R and Python. For the full list of choices, see <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/Metrics/Metrics.pdf">Metrics</a> for R, and <a href="http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/model_evaluation.html#scoring-parameter">Scoring</a> in Python.</p>
