<h1>Machine Learning Reference</h1>
<p>
	Machine learning is such an expansive field, with tons of algorithms, tricks, and tecniques. However, resources are disorganized. Part of the problem stems from the diversity of the field, which attracts computer scientists, mathematicians, statisticians, people of various domains, and self-taught programmers. While everyone has a role to play, they each have different focuses. Self-taught programmers, in particular, probably dominate the blog space, have lots of heuristics for which algorithms to use, but little patience for theory. On the other hand, academics expound the math for days but lack attention to implementation details.</p>

	<p>The purpose of this site is to have a little bit of both. Here, I will compile a list of related topics and algorithms, some of the theory that I've gathered from various sources, and their respective implemention in R and Python. Where relevant, I may also include Tensorflow and Keras code in the future. The point is to have a quick reference all in one place without having to do a lot of research, especially for the beginner-intermediate learner. Python's <span class="code">sklearn</span> library has excellent documentation, but it's filled with jargon, and it's not always apparent how to use each feature. R's libraries are disparate, and while experienced users have a list of favorites, beginners often don't know where to look. For example <span class="code">caret</span> is one of the most popular machine learning libraries for R, but how would someone know this?

<p>Everything contained in this site is original content. I did peruse various sources in compiling this information. Unfortunately, I did not keep track of them. I will a works cited in the future. Please note that while I do try my hardest to fact check all the assertions in here, I cannot guarantee that everything is correct. If you're referring to this for anything important, do double check with other sources.</p>
