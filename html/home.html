<h1>Machine Learning Reference</h1>
<p>
	Machine learning is such an expansive field. There are tons of algorithms a
	budding data scientists should learn about, but there are no comprehensive
	resources. The data that does exist is fragmented. Here, I will compile a
	list of topics and algorithms, and their respective code in R, Python, and 
	Tensorflow.
