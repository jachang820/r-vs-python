<p>Imputation attempts to solve the problem of filling in missing values in 
	in the data frame. Imputing the mean value is almost never appropriate, 
	since it disregards the underlying correlation structure. Other common 
	methods are, for example, kNN (K-nearest neighbors), FKM (fuzzy K-means), 
	SVD (singular value decomposition), bPCA (Bayesian principal component 
	analysis), and MICE (multiple imputations by chained equations). MICE is 
	much more complex and performs well with small datasets, but inconsistently 
	with larger ones. Perhaps, bPCA and FKM are better performers all around (<a

<p>The easiest method may be to simply drop examples with missing values,
	although this may be inappropriate since it may delete important data.

<p>The example below demonstrates 3 methods:
	<ul>
		<li>Dropping missing values</li>
		<li>Imputing the mean</li>
		<li>Imputing with MICE, with 100 imputations.</li>
	</ul>
