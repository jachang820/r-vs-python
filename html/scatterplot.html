<p>The code below demonstrates how to do a simple scatter plot and regression line in both R and Python. Python's <span class="code">matplotlib.pyplot</span> imitates the style of Matlab. R's <span class="code">ggplot2</span> is an implementation of Leland Wilkinson's The Grammar of Graphics, with the idea that graphs are a variety of components added together.</p>

<p>Sometimes, it is useful to plot a range of points more densely. This is especially true in the case of CART algorithms that have levels representing each node, such that the line should look like a staircase. However, without interpolation points between the points in the dataset, the graph will merely draw a line directly between two points, which grossly misrepresents the decision boundary. The <span class="code">smooth_regression_line()</span> function below mainly seeks to demonstrate how to fill in a range of points between two bounds.</p>
