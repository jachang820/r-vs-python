<p>This code create \(k\) randomized folds in a feature matrix and performs k-folds cross-validation for the purposes of finding an optimal hyperparameter according to a scoring metric.</p>

<p>Specifically, instead of testing how a tuned model generalizes, it uses cross-validation \(n\) times and reports the best score out of a given range for the tested hyperparameter. </p>

<p>The code below demonstrates, for example, how k-folds cross-validation might be used to find the best \(k\) in the k-nearest neighbors model.</p>
