<p>Sometimes it is useful to binarize a vector or matrix such that all values above a threshold becomes <span class="code">TRUE</span> or 1, and all values below or equal to the threshold becomes <span class="code">FALSE</span> or 0. For example, this is often used to interpret probabilistic models like the logistic regression, or a classification output layer to a neural network. Other times, it may be necessary to create ordered categories, such as age decades or economic quintiles. The code below provides an easy way to accomplish this.</p>
