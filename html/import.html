<p>We suppose that there is a csv (comma-separated values) file called 
	'data.csv'.

<p>R has built-in functions to describe summary statistics and dataset
	structure. The Pandas equivalents aren't as expressive, and takes additional
	wrangling to achieve the same results. Specifically, summary in R displays
	mode and missing values for categorical data, and min, 1st quarter, median, 
	mean, 3rd quarter, and max for continuous data. Structure displays
	observations and features of the data frame, data type, and a head.
